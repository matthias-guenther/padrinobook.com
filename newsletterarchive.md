    <h2>February - 2014</h2>
    <p>Hio,</p>

    <p>after moving houses and finally getting used in the new environment I started again working on the book again. Before going on, I decided to create a new style for the book website <a href="http://padrinobook.com">http://padrinobook.com</a>. I added the following features:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>switched from bootstrap to gumby which make the site more responsive</li>
      <li>add more contribution links</li>
      <li>add twitter for social sharing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Huge parts of the page were programmed but exists only as commented HTML. In the future when the time has come I will make them more and more available.</p>

    <p>
    Have a good start in the week and you will hear from me in two weeks.
    </p>

    <p>
    Kindly regards,
    </p>

    <h2>Progress February - March 2014</h2>
    <p>Hio,</p>

    <p> I finally got an own mail address matthias@padrinobook.com from which the updates are send now. I also add a "Recent commit" section on <a href="http://padrinobook.com/">http://padrinobook.com</a> as a reminder to see the last commits for the book.
    </p>

    <p> Designing a logo is not difficult, all you need is to have a name, a slogan, and some design in your head. You can see results on <a href="http://padrinobook.com/logos.html">http://padrinobook.com/logos.html</a>, thanks for the feedback on twitter I got from <a href="https://twitter.com/nesquena/statuses/438551498956349440">Nathan Esquenazi</a>.
    </p>

    <p> I made some small improvement on the website and made it more responsive. According to your device, a different version of the logo is loaded.
    </p>

    <p> When I finished designing the logo, <a href="https://twitter.com/tomparandyk">Tom Parandyk</a> from <a href="http://www.uxtemple.com/">http://www.uxtemple.com/</a> honored my effort in creating a logo but offered me his help to create a more modern branding. I'm very happy that he is going to help me and I will update the page as soon as the logo is ready.
    </p>

    <p> For the next two weeks, I'm planning to finish the chapter about edit the user profile, write a blog post about deploying padrino applications for <a href="https://www.heroku.com">https://www.heroku.com</a> and <a href="http://www.anynines.com">http://www.anynines.com</a> - that is a thing which should be easy to do with Padrino. And I think of updating the book to padrino 0.12.
    </p>

    <p>Have a good start in the week and you will hear from me in two weeks.</p>

    <p>Kindly regards,</p>

    <h2>Progress March 2014: Logo, Twitter, and Deployment</h2>
    <p>Hio,</p>

    <p>another two weeks have passed by and finally the spring is coming. As mentioned in the last newsletter, <a href="https://twitter.com/tomparandyk">Tom Parandyk</a> from <a href="http://www.uxtemple.com/">http://www.uxtemple.com/</a> made an awesome job and created a modern branding for the book <a href="http://padrinobook.com/logo.png">logo</a>. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I also managed to refresh the layout of the twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/padrinobook">https://twitter.com/padrinobook</a> with the new brand - I'm very happy about having 22 followers. Hopefully this number will increase very fast.
    </p>

    <p>The application around the book <a href="https://github.com/wikimatze/job-vacancy">job-vacancy</a> was upgraded to padrino 0.12 and it is still working as well as the tests.
    </p>

    <p>Last but not least I wrote an article about <a href="http://wikimatze.de/deploying-padrino-applications-on-heroku.html">"Deploying Padrino Applications On Heroku"</a>. Feel free to read it and learn how you can bring your applications into the real world.</p>

    <p>That's it for today, enjoy the rest of the week. You will hear from me in two weeks.</p>

    <p>Kindly regards,</p>
