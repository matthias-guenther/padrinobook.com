title: Progress February 2014
---

Hio,

after moving houses and finally getting used in the new environment I started again working on the
book again. Before going on, I decided to create a new style for the book website
[padrinobook.com](http://padrinobook.com/). I added the following features:


- switched from bootstrap to [Gumby](http://gumbyframework.com/) which make the site more responsive
- add more contribution links
- add twitter for social sharing


Huge parts of the page were programmed but exists only as commented HTML. In the future when the time has come I will make them more and more available.


Have a good start in the week and you will hear from me in two weeks.


Kindly regards,


Matthias GÃ¼nther
