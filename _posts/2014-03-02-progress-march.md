Hio,

I finally got an own mail address <matthias@padrinobook.com> from which the updates are send now.


Designing a logo is not so difficult, all you need is to have a name, a slogan, and some design in your head. You can see
results on [logos](https://padrinobook.com/logos.html), thanks for the feedback on twitter I got from [Nathan Esquenazi](https://twitter.com/nesquena/statuses/438551498956349440).


I made some small improvement on the website and made it more responsive. According to your device, a different version of the logo is loaded.


When I finished designing the logo, [Tom Parandyk](https://twitter.com/tomparandyk) from [uxtemple.com](http://www.uxtemple.com/) honored my effort in creating a logo but offered me his help to create a more modern branding. I'm very happy that he is going to help me and I will update the page as soon as the logo is ready.


For the next two weeks, I'm planning to finish the chapter about edit the user profile, write a blog post about deploying padrino applications for [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and [anynines](http://www.anynines.com/) - that is a thing which should be easy to do with Padrino. And I think of updating the book to padrino 0.12.


Have a good start in the week and you will hear from me in two weeks.

Kindly regards,

Matthias GÃ¼nther
