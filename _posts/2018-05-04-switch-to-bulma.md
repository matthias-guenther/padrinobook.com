Hi,

after a couple of time I switched the css framework of this page from [twitter bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "twitter bootstrap") to [bulma](https://bulma.io/ "bulma") which is an open source CSS framework based on [flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp "flexbox").

Best regards

Matthias
