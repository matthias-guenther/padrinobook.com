title: Switched to Padrino 0.12.2 and fixing a lot of clutter words
---

Hi,

during the last two weeks I was fixing a lot of grammar problems int the book and removed clutter words like easy, however, so, or just. I have even written a blog post about how to [Highlight Bad Words In Vim](http://wikimatze.de/highlight-bad-words-in-vim).


I got used to GitHub issues as my workflow when I detect problems during my writting which I don't want to fix right now but later. If you found an issue, feel free to post it [PadrinoBook issues](https://github.com/wikimatze/PadrinoBook/issues/new)


A code smell is part of your source code which may be the root of a design problem but is not actually a bug. It's good to have some tools to be "lord of the smells" for [Padrino](http://www.padrinorb.com/). I've written about possible tools under ["Code Coverage Tools For Padrino"](http://wikimatze.de/code-coverage-tools-for-padrino). Since I have a small side section about code coverage tools in the book so, would it okay for you to have a link to the article in the book instead of putting the content directly in the book? Please write me your opinion under <mailto:matthias@padrinobook.com>.


In the last weekend it was [eurucamp 2014 time](http://2014.eurucamp.org/).

I went there and visited a workshop from [Luca Guidi](http://lucaguidi.com/) about the [lotus framework](http://lotusrb.org/) which is similar to Padrino but has some differences. Would you like to have a chapter in the book explaining more the differences between Padrino and other frameworks like Lotus? Write me your opinion directly per mail <mailto:matthias@padrinobook.com> or via [twitter (@wikimatze)](http://twitter.com/padrinobook).


Best regards,

Matthias
