Hi,

I was thinking a lot about the brand and how to push the page forward. Marketing was (and still is) new for me and I learned so many thinks from it, that this will be the content for another post or mail.

Now see what I did during the last couple of months:


- Installed the new logo on every platform
- Changed my github name from matthias-guenther to [wikimatze](https://github.com/wikimatze) because that is name I use everywhere
- Renamed the github URL from padrino-book to [padrinobook](https://github.com/wikimatze/padrinobook)
- Merged the [user-profile branch](https://github.com/wikimatze/padrinobook/commit/8a55603281e70e9dc4e3970ab49efd2302d2ee8c?short_path=fb48dc1&unchanged=collapsed#diff-fb48dc120e2365fa90d03e42d02cc4d4) into master and learned that is not a good idea to work with branches for a long time because it makes the integration of other contributors more difficult
- Add [newsletter-archive](http://padrinobook.com/newsletterarchive) section so you can read older entries from the mailing list
- Create a [facebook fanpage](https://www.facebook.com/Padrinobook)
- Switched from [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/padrinobook) to [softcover](https://www.softcover.io/books/fd219c19/padrinobook)
- Get rid of numbering the sections of the book and reorder whole chapters
- Add the book logo into the [README](https://github.com/wikimatze/PadrinoBook/blob/master/README.md)


I thank all the readers of the mailing list for giving me feedback about the book. In order to make contributing easier I created a free available HTML Version of the book under [padrinobook.com/book](http://padrinobook.com/book/). Please let me know if you like this way of contributing.


Now enjoy watching the soccer worldcup finale game and have a good start in the week.

Best regards,

Matthias
