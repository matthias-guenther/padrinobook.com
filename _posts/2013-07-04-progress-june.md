Hio

another two weeks have passed by and finally the spring is coming. As mentioned in the last newsletter, [Tom Parandyk](https://twitter.com/tomparandyk) from [uxtemple.com](http://www.uxtemple.com) made an awesome job and created a modern branding for the book [logo](https://padrinobook.com/logo.png). I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I also managed to refresh the layout of the twitter account [twitter.com/padrinobook](https://twitter.com/padrinobook) with the new brand - I'm very happy about having 22 followers. Hopefully this number will increase very fast.


The application around the book [job-vacany](https://github.com/wikimatze/job-vacancy) was upgraded to padrino 0.12 and it is still working as well as the tests.


That's it for today, enjoy the rest of the week. You will hear from me in two weeks.

Kindly regards,

Matthias GÃ¼nther
